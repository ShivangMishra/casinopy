# casinopy
Blender automation script for assistance in creation of a casino game, which started out only as a blender automation and video rendering project. The game project was completed in Unity engine. I've left this script here to serve as example code for common bpy operations.<br>
This project uses <a href='https://github.com/python-eel/Eel'> eel </a > for creating a simple GUI. <br>
The inputs from the eel GUI are passed to the main.py script. The main.py saves the configuration locally. <br>  
The main.py file runs casino script with a blender context (need to set up blender path). <br>
casino.py handles all the blender operations.
